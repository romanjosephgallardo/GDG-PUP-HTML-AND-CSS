    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> 
        Hi, I am Roman Joseph C. Gallardo, a Computer Engineering student from 
        Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I am 19 years old and currently in 
        my 2nd year of my course. I don't have the best skills in terms of any programming
        language but I am currently learning Web Development.
    </p>

    <h2> My Hobbies </h2>
    <p>
        I love listening to music and watching movies. I also love playing video games like Minecraft
        and Tekken Games. I am a self-taught visual editor and I love editing videos and photos. I also
        do mashups and remixes of any songs that I like and I post them on YouTube. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I really love listening to music especially to the genre of Rap, R&B, and Pop. I love listening to
        certain artists like Doja Cat, Nicki Minaj, Charli xcx, and now I am currently in love to Mariah Carey discography.
    </p>

    <h2> Skills </h2>
    <p>
        I am currently learning Web Development and I am enjoying it. I am also improving my skills for photo and video editing.
        I also make mashups and remixes by using FL Studio and other DAWs for music production. I don't have the best skills in terms of programming
        but I am willing to learn and improve my skills.
    </p>
